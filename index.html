        <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. </p>
        <p>Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. </p>
        <p>Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. </p>
        <p>That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. </p>
        <p>That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. </p>
        <p>If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. </p>
        <p>If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. </p>
        <p>Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake. </p>
        <p>They’re proofs to that. </p>
        <p>Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. </p>
        <p>Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. </p>
        <p>But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. </p>
        <p>Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

    </figure>
    <figure>
        <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. </p>
        <p> That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. </p>
        <p> They said, <q class="villager"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” </q> </p>
        <p> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">“Is it <span class="good"> good </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.” </q></p>
        <p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
        <p> <q class="villager">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </q></p>
        <p> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">“Is it <span class="good"> good </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.” </q> </p>
        <p> The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. </p>
        <p> The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad"> bad </span>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <span class="good"> good </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.” </q></p>
        <p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. </p>
        <p> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <q class="farmer">“Is it <span class="good"> good </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.”</q> </p>
        <p> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, </p>
        <p> and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good"> good </span> or <span class="bad"> bad </span> — </p>
        <p> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; </p>
        <p> or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good"> good </span> fortune. </p>

    <p>Conclusion  </p>
    <p><span class="good"> Good </span> and <span class="bad"> Bad </span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good"> good </span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good"> good </span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
